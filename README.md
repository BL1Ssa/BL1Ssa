# HELLO THERE

Just quick introduction. My name is Brandon Lim Santosa. I am from Indonesia and also a student in BINUS UNIVERSITY (graduated at 2027 :3, i hope hehe...)
And This is my First Commit in GitHub so many times i saw many applications and websites that are so spectacular for me. So maybe I decided to commit this :3...
Also, this is my first journey to commit something so yeah, I will push something sooner about my thought or maybe you can share about your knowledge because I don't know how to
get people to share their thoughts hehehe...

Anyways, Thank you for reading.
